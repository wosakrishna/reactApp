            The koala bear, Australiaâ€™s national icon, is on the verge of extinction, say wildlife experts and researchers. Wildlife detection dogs that can identify koala bears, and, therefore, their population, is one of the techniques being used to detect how low the density of this species actually is. The community of koala bears has reduced more than ten times in Australia.

Science for Wildlife is working for the conservation of koala bears that are being pushed towards extinction in the mountain regions, due to natural calamities. Once the population of this national treasure gets mapped, community protection groups can help protecting and rehabilitating them.
